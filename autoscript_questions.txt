1. What is stream patterning?

2. What is 'set_default_application_file('Si')'?

3. Why is the gas_type to be set for each pattern? Does this make sense at all?

4. Why does the field width need to be adjusted? microscope.beams.ion_beam.horizontal_field_width.value = 20e-6

5. Is drift corrected patterning (DCP) needed when fiducial is milled?

- Lamella position is defined twice in ProjectData.dat file:
